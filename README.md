a shorter version of the theoretical demonstration for the Budget Tracker project:

1.Sign Up: User creates an account by entering credentials. Frontend sends a POST request to the backend (Flask) to register the user.
2.Login: User logs in with their credentials. The backend verifies them, generates a JWT token, and sends it to the frontend.
3.Dashboard: User views income, expenses, and remaining balance. Frontend makes a GET request to fetch data.
4.Budget Tracking: User tracks budget progress and gets alerts if they exceed their budget.
5.Logout: User logs out, and the frontend deletes the JWT token, ending the session.
